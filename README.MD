# Project 3 - *Parstagram*

**Parstagram** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication.
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account.
- [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts.
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram".

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees app icon in home screen and styled bottom navigation view
- [ ] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed.
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show an indeterminate progress bar while the post is being uploaded to Parse.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
  - Added log-out and sign-up buttons with working functionality. In the future I will create a separate signupactivity & layout

## Notes

1. Understanding back-end, attributes/variables, background tasks, threading.
2. Learning how to access camera with implicit intent was exciting! I look forward to learning more about android sensors/hardware as well as using them for cool apps.

## Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Parse](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) - Parse is a cloud-based backend service to build data-driven applcations quickly
